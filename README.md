# ENVIRONMENTAL-MONITORING-USING-BMP280
This project creates a compact Environmental Monitoring System (EMS) using a BMP280 sensor, OLED display, and ESP32 microcontroller on the GISMO VII board. It measures temperature and pressure, displays real-time data locally, and syncs with Firebase for cloud storage and mobile app access, enabling remote monitoring and analysis.
